Source: RevenueCat State of Subscription Apps 2025 (summarized for internal use)
Confidence: Medium (directional planning guidance)

## Goals
Design onboarding to maximize:
- Trial start rate
- Trial to paid conversion
- Annual subscription adoption
- Long-term retention (LTV)

## High-Converting Onboarding Flow
1. Identify user problem
2. Personalize experience (scan, quiz, or setup)
3. Demonstrate value before paywall
4. Present paywall with trial offer

## Key Onboarding Rules
- The decision to subscribe happens before the paywall screen
- Show personalized results before subscription prompt
- Build emotional commitment before pricing exposure

## Paywall Placement in Onboarding
- Paywall should appear inside onboarding
- Avoid delaying paywall until later sessions

## Trial Principles
- Majority of trial starts occur on Day-0; show paywall early
- Trial length: 7–14 days
- Trial attached to annual plan by default
- Clearly display Cancel anytime

## Benchmarks (Targets)
Typical subscription app ranges:
- Download to Trial: 6–12%
- Trial to Paid: 30–50%
- Download to Paid: 1–5%

Top performers can reach roughly 2-3x these levels, often with stronger onboarding and paywall execution.

Benchmark note:
- Treat ranges as planning baselines and validate against your own funnel.

## Optimization Strategy
Core focus areas:
- Onboarding clarity
- Value communication
- Paywall timing
- Annual adoption rate

A/B tests:
- Trial length (7 vs 14 days)
- Paywall timing (early vs delayed)
- Multi-screen vs single-screen paywall
- Different value messaging
