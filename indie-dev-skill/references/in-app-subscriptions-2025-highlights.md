Source: Adapty Pricing Index / State of In-App Subscriptions 2025 (summarized for internal use)
Confidence: Medium (cross-market directional signals)

## Market and Plan Mix
- Weekly plans are the fastest-growing and capture a large share of revenue in several categories, including Utilities, Productivity, and Photo & Video.
- Annual plans lead in Health & Fitness and Education where long-term commitment is more common.
- One-time purchases are rising, reinforcing hybrid monetization.

## Regional Insights
- The US is the largest subscription revenue region (~48.9%), Europe is second (~24.8%), APAC is growing (~10.3%).
- Weekly plans lead revenue share across regions; Europe shows more diversified mixes (monthly and one-time share higher).

## Pricing and Conversion
- Flexible pricing can improve conversion; weekly plans can act as a low-commitment entry point.
- Practical pattern: convert with weekly, then upsell to longer-term plans via onboarding and secondary prompts.
- Annual plans can be framed as a monthly equivalent to improve perceived value.

## Paywall Tactics for Annual Adoption
- Preselect annual (12M) and show it as Best Value.
- Use a decoy plan to make annual feel dominant.
- Offer a discount or a secondary paywall after install or post-trial cancellation.
- Reduce trial anxiety with clear reminders and “cancel anytime.”

## Trials and LTV
- Trials raise 12‑month LTV meaningfully across regions (e.g., strong lifts in US and Europe).
- Weekly plans often lead trial LTV across regions, while annual trials can underperform without strong paywall design.

## Benchmark Usage Notes
- Use these observations as strategy inputs, not fixed rules.
- Validate by category and region before broad rollout.
