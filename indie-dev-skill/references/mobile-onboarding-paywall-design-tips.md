# Mobile Onboarding + Paywall Design Tips

Use these UI rules to improve clarity and conversion for indie mobile apps.

## Onboarding Design
- Keep onboarding short: usually 3-5 screens before paywall.
- Use one clear purpose per screen (problem, personalization, value reveal).
- Require at least one interaction before paywall (selection, quiz, setup, scan, toggle).
- Show progress (e.g., step indicator) to reduce drop-off anxiety.
- Use concrete outcomes ("Save 30 minutes/week"), not generic feature lists.

## Paywall Placement
- Show the paywall at the end of onboarding after interaction and value reveal.
- Avoid showing pricing before user context is established.
- If user skips onboarding, show a lightweight value summary before the paywall.

## Paywall Visual Hierarchy
- Keep annual plan visually dominant as the default.
- Place weekly as second option to reduce commitment friction.
- Keep monthly optional third option where needed.
- Show equivalent monthly cost for annual near the annual price.
- Keep "Cancel anytime" and trial terms visible near CTA.

## Copy + CTA Design
- Use one primary headline focused on user outcome.
- Keep supporting copy short (2-4 bullets max).
- Use a specific CTA ("Start 7-day free trial"), not vague labels.
- Add short loss-aversion text near CTA ("Keep unlimited exports and no ads").

## Trust + Friction Control
- Include lightweight trust signals (rating, user count, testimonial snippet).
- Keep restore and terms links visible but visually secondary.
- Avoid aggressive countdowns or deceptive urgency patterns.
- Ensure tap targets and text are readable on smaller screens.

## Indie Practical Defaults
- Build one reusable paywall template and iterate copy/plan order first.
- Test one variable at a time (headline, default plan, trial length, CTA text).
- Start with annual+trial default, then test weekly-first only if trial starts are weak.
