# Mobile-App Onboarding - Key Guidance

## Core Principles
- Skip dedicated onboarding whenever possible; invest in usability instead.
- Instructional onboarding rarely improves task performance in simple apps.
- Prefer in-context tips and error messages over up-front tutorials.

## When Onboarding Is Justified
Use dedicated onboarding screens only if:
- You need user info to get started (e.g., account creation, identity confirmation).
- The app requires user-specific setup to be useful (context or preferences).
- The workflow is novel or non-standard and genuinely unfamiliar to users.

If unsure, test without onboarding first and add it only if users fail to complete key tasks.

## Onboarding Components (Use Sparingly)
Three common components:
- Feature promotion
- Customization
- Instructions

### Feature Promotion
- Avoid feature-promotion onboarding at first launch.
- If a feature is novel or unfamiliar, keep it brief and skippable.
- Prefer app-store previews or contextual prompts later in the flow.

### Customization
- Content customization can be appropriate early.
- Visual theme selection should be deferred until users understand the UI.
- Keep questions brief and explain why the data is needed.

### Instructions
- Don’t use instructions to compensate for poor design.
- If used, make it brief, optional, and focused on need-to-know.
- Deck-of-cards tutorials are generally discouraged.
- Instructional overlays should be timely and unobtrusive.
- Interactive walkthroughs can help only for genuinely novel workflows.
