# Paywall Playbook (Utility Apps, 2025)

Source: RevenueCat State of Subscription Apps 2025 (summarized for internal use)
Confidence: Medium (directional planning guidance)

## Goals
Design paywall, pricing, and trial strategy to maximize:
- Trial start rate
- Trial to paid conversion
- Annual subscription adoption
- Long-term retention (LTV)

## Pricing Strategy
Default plan configuration:
- Weekly: $4.99
- Monthly: $5.99
- Annual: $29.99 (recommended highlight)

Pricing rules:
- Annual price should be ~60–70% discount vs monthly total
- Annual plan must be visually highlighted as Best Value
- Default selected plan = Annual
- Always display equivalent monthly cost for annual plan
- If data suggests high Day-0 commitment friction, consider testing weekly-first entry with annual upsell

Regional pricing:
- Adjust pricing for purchasing power
- Western Europe and North America can support higher prices
- Lower-income regions should receive stronger annual discounts

## Trial Strategy
Recommended trial setup:
- Trial length: 7–14 days
- Trial offered immediately during onboarding
- Trial attached to annual plan by default
- Clearly display Cancel anytime

Trial principles:
- Majority of trial starts occur on Day-0; show paywall early
- Longer trials generally convert better than very short trials
- Avoid hiding trial inside deep feature flows

## Paywall Strategy
Placement:
- Paywall should appear inside onboarding
- Avoid delaying paywall until later sessions

Design rules:
- Use multi-screen paywalls instead of a single long screen
- Present value explanation before pricing
- Highlight premium benefits visually
- Use loss-aversion messaging (what user loses if skipping)

Components:
- Feature value screens
- Social proof or credibility
- Trial explanation
- Pricing selection screen

## Monetization Model
Recommended model: hybrid monetization
- Subscription for full access
- Consumables or lifetime purchases as optional alternatives

Example:
- Subscription: unlimited usage
- Consumable: one-time cleaning credits or extra usage
- Lifetime purchase: premium unlock option

## Benchmarks (Targets)
Typical subscription app ranges:
- Download to Trial: 6–12%
- Trial to Paid: 30–50%
- Download to Paid: 1–5%

Top performers can reach roughly 2-3x these levels, often with stronger onboarding and paywall execution.

Benchmark note:
- Treat these as rough target bands, then tune with app-specific experiments.

## Optimization Strategy
Core focus areas:
- Paywall timing
- Onboarding clarity
- Value communication
- Plan hierarchy visibility
- Annual adoption rate

A/B tests:
- Trial length (7 vs 14 days)
- Paywall timing (early vs delayed)
- Annual vs monthly default selection
- Multi-screen vs single-screen paywall
- Different value messaging
