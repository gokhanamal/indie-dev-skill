# State of Subscription Apps 2025 - Highlights (Onboarding + Paywall)

Confidence: Medium (derived from summary notes, use as directional guidance)

## Core Takeaways
- Trial starts are overwhelmingly Day 0; paywall exposure in onboarding is critical.
- Top performers win on onboarding clarity, paywall placement, and value messaging more than on pricing alone.
- Hybrid monetization is increasingly common (subscriptions plus consumables or lifetime).

## Day 0 Trial Behavior
- Day-0 trial starts are reported in the ~80-82% range across sections.
- Time-to-trial charts indicate most categories are above 80% on Day 0.
- Treat this as source-reported variance, not an exact constant.

## Trial Start Rate (Leverage Point)
- P90 apps reach ~20.3% trial start rate.
- Median trial start rate cited at ~6.2%.
- Top apps are ~3x better at trial starts than the median.

## Paywall Placement and Visibility
- Apps that surface their paywall during onboarding outperform those that delay it.
- Trial opt-in correlates with paywall view rate and number of paywall exposures (quality matters).

## Trial Length and Conversion
- Longer trials convert better in aggregate; 17–32 day trials show ~45.7% median conversion.
- Shorter trials (3-day, 7-day) have higher Day 0 and Day 1 cancellation rates.
- Cancellations spike near the end of the trial period; retention nudges should focus here.

## Benchmark Usage Notes
- Use all metrics as rough targets for experiment planning.
- Do not treat these values as guaranteed outcomes for individual apps.

## Pricing and Conversion
- Higher prices correlate with higher trial-to-paid conversion at median, but pricing alone doesn’t fix poor execution.
- Execution (onboarding + paywall clarity) matters more than price changes alone.

## Paywall Model (Hard vs Freemium)
- Hard paywalls convert users faster on Day 0.
- Best freemium apps can still achieve strong Day 0 conversion when onboarding and messaging are strong.

## Monetization Mix
- Subscriptions are increasingly paired with consumables or lifetime purchases (hybrid monetization).
